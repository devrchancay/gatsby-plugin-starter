### GATSBY PLUGIN STARTER

Basic configuration that I use to create my gatsby plugins, is inspired by the official plugins.

### How to use

1. git clone --depth 1 -b master https://github.com/devrchancay/gatsby-plugin-starter.git
2. Change the "name" in `package.json` with the conversion of gatsby plugins.
3. Happy Hacking
